# VSort
VSort is a console-based application designed to help users visualize and understand various sorting algorithms. The program provides an interactive interface where users can select different sorting algorithms and observe the step-by-step process of sorting a list of integers. This was especially made for CSci 104 - Algorithms and Complexity.
